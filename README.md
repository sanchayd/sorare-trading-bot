## Security Features

### Emergency Stop System

The emergency stop system allows you to immediately halt all trading operations, useful in case of:
- Unusual market volatility
- API issues
- Unexpected bot behavior
- System maintenance

Emergency stops persist across bot restarts, ensuring trading doesn't resume until explicitly cleared.

Commands:
```
emergency status              - Check emergency stop status
emergency stop <reason>       - Trigger emergency stop
emergency clear               - Clear emergency stop
emergency clear-force         - Force clear emergency stop (use with caution)
```

### Transaction Rate Limiting

The bot implements a sliding-window rate limiter that prevents executing more than a configurable number of transactions per hour. This:
- Prevents excessive trading during volatile markets
- Limits potential losses if issues occur
- Reduces API rate limit issues
- Provides a more predictable trading pattern

Configure the limit in `config.properties`:
```properties
trading.max.transactions.per.hour=5
```

## High-Priority Player Monitoring

The bot includes a special system for monitoring specific players more frequently and using different buying rules:

### Key Features
- **Separate 5-minute monitoring cycle** for high-priority players
- **Sales history tracking** for informed buying decisions
- **Buy when price is below historical average** instead of below floor price
- **Automatic history building** if no sales data is available yet
- **Flexible priority list** stored in an easy-to-edit text file

### Configuration

High-priority players are stored in a simple text file:
```
# Format: player_id,rarity
0x123456789abcdef,limited
0xabcdef123456789,super_rare
```

Command line management:
```
priority add <player_id> <rarity>    - Add a player to high-priority list
priority remove <player_id>          - Remove a player from high-priority list
priority list                        - List all high-priority players
priority history <player_id> <rarity> - View sales history for a player
```

### How It Works

1. Every 5 minutes, the bot scans the market for your high-priority players
2. If the lowest current price is below the average of the last 5 sales, it buys the card
3. The card is listed for sale at either the average price or a 5% markup (whichever is higher)
4. Each purchase updates the sales history, allowing the system to adapt to market trends

## Using the Bot

### Adding Players to Watch

After starting the bot, use these commands:
```
add <player_id> <rarity>     # Add player to watchlist
remove <player_id>           # Remove player from watchlist
list                         # List watched players
```

### Special Card Notifications

```
serial add 66 limited        # Get notified about card #66/100 in limited rarity
serial add 1                 # Get notified about any card #1/X
jersey on                    # Enable jersey mint notifications
jersey price 0.5             # Only notify for jersey mints under 0.5 ETH
```

### Custom Trading Rules

To implement your own custom logic:

1. **Modify the price evaluation strategy**
   
   Edit `TradingEngine.java` and locate the `PriceEvaluator` inner class:
   ```java
   private static class PriceEvaluator {
       // Change this value to adjust discount threshold (default 15%)
       private static final BigDecimal SIGNIFICANT_DISCOUNT = new BigDecimal("0.85");
       
       public boolean isUndervalued(BigDecimal cardPrice, BigDecimal floorPrice) {
           // Your custom logic here
           return cardPrice.compareTo(thresholdPrice) < 0;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add custom notification rules**
   
   Extend the `checkForSpecialCard` method in `TradingEngine.java`:
   ```java
   private void checkForSpecialCard(Card card) {
       // Existing checks...
       
       // Your custom condition
       if (card.getPlayerName().contains("Messi") && card.getPrice().compareTo(BigDecimal.valueOf(1.0)) < 0) {
           notificationService.notifySpecialCard(card, "Messi card under 1 ETH!");
       }
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use Transaction Rate Limiting**: Start conservative with a low limit (3-5 transactions per hour)
2. **Use a Dedicated Wallet**: Always use a wallet with limited funds for the bot
3. **Test the Emergency Stop**: Regularly test that the emergency stop works as expected
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check logs regularly for warnings or errors
5. **Test on Testnet First**: Use Sepolia or other testnets before deploying to mainnet

### High-Priority Player Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with just a few high-priority players you know well
2. **Review Sales History**: Check the price history with `priority history` before buying
3. **Seed Market Data**: Add known fair prices to start building the history
4. **Add Top Players**: Target popular players with high trading volume for best results
5. **Adjust Notification Settings**: Set up alerts to stay informed about high-priority transactions

## Testing Before Deployment

1. **Use a testnet first**
   ```properties
   ethereum.node.url=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
   ```

2. **Set conservative limits**
   ```properties
   trading.max.eth.per.transaction=0.05
   trading.max.transactions.per.hour=3
   ```

3. **Monitor logs**
   ```
   tail -f logs/sorarebot.log
   ```
